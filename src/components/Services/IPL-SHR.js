            Whether born with them or acquired over the course of a lifetime,
            virtually everyone has one or more sun spots, freckles or skin
            discolouration they'd love to get rid of! A doctor's letter
            confirming that no skin cancers are present is usually required
            before commencing your treatment cycles.

        <Service title="Rejuvenation Treatment" price="POA">
          <p>
            Everybody loves the sunshine! However, in the long term, sun
            exposure decreases the production of collagen, which in turn causes
            damage to the skin making it feel wrinkled and coarse and looking
            red and tired. Skin rejuvenation treatments will improve skin tone,
            texture, refine and refresh the skin by increasing the production of
            collagen in the skin.

            Our trained clinicians can offer treatments which will reduce facial

          <p>
            Our trained clinicians are now able to offer IPL based acne
            management programs. These unique treatments are designed to
            specifically slow the overall production of oil that leads to acne,
            thus dramatically reducing the chance of spots and minimising the
            appearance of pores in general.

        <h4 className="font-bold mt-6">What is Super Hair Removal (SHR)?</h4>
        <p>
          Laser and IPL hair removal is undoubtedly the most effective way to
          remove unwanted hair for the long run. But if the thought of pain or
          discomfort has been keeping you away, LUX Series SHR is for you. LUX
          Series SHR gradually heats the hair follicle with repetitive low
          fluence pulses until the hair follicle is destroyed instead of a
          single high-heat, high-energy pulse that many other lasers and IPL
          use.
        </p>
        <h4 className="font-bold mt-6">The results?</h4>
        <p>
